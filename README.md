# Data On-Demand
### Self-Service BI Infrastructure for Data Democratization
> Designed and implemented a self-service Business Intelligence (BI)
            infrastructure to empower users across the organization with
            accessible, reliable data. Built robust ETL/ELT pipelines to
            integrate and transform data from multiple critical systems,
            including Corebanking, Dynamics 365 FinOps, and automation
            platforms. This initiative enabled real-time insights, reduced
            dependency on IT for reporting, and promoted a culture of
            data-driven decision-making.
